## GitHub Issues
Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mrchipset/Captura/issues) for Bug Reports, Feature Requests and Questions.


## Mail
Try to use GitHub Issues instead of mailing, it allows us to track your Feature Requests and Bug Reports better.

Use mail only in cases where personal information is involved and you think it's neccessary to send me an email.
Please specify what you want help with in the mail itself instead of asking for other contact information like phone number or social account details.
